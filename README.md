# portfolio-app
I built this portfolio app with Django REST framework and ReactJS for frontend

The website folder contains the backend content in Django framework. The src folder contains the frontend React code (folder from which the project should be run)

Requirements:
1. Install Django and Django REST framework in your local system 
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/install/

2. Create a React app using the following link.
https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

Copy the src folder into the src folder of you app

Run the code:
1. Open the React app folder in terminal or CMD and type the command 'npm start'. 
The website should open in a new browser window
